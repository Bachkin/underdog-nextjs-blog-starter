Blockchains can be thought of as virtual cities, with many similarities between the two concepts.

First, just like cities have a large number of residents who contribute to the overall functioning and development of the city, blockchains have a large number of users who all contribute to the overall functioning and security of the network.

Second, cities have rules, programs, and regulations that govern how things are done, and similarly, blockchains have consensus mechanisms that govern how transactions are processed. Certain protocols are implemented to ensure that the network functions smoothly.

Lastly, cities have authorities and governing bodies that make decisions and run efficiently. In the same way, blockchains have nodes or validators who validate transactions. These nodes or validators help to reach consensus on the state of the network, similar to how governing bodies in a city make decisions and maintain order.

It's worth noting that blockchains network are decentralized which is different than cities, which have centralized governing structures, but the analogy helps to illustrate the similarities between the two in terms of the number of participants, the rules and regulations that govern the system, and the entities responsible for maintaining order and making decisions.

Overall, the "blockchains are cities" mental model is a useful way to understand the inner workings of a blockchain network, and how it functions as a decentralized system with many participants working towards a common goal.
